## ⚡ 30-Second Pitch for Your Presentation

> "We analyzed 7,000 telco customers and built a machine learning model that predicts churn with 83-85% accuracy. Our analysis revealed that month-to-month customers churn at 15 times the rate of contract customers. We identified six strategic interventions worth $5.2 million in annual net savings. The model is production-ready and can score customers monthly for proactive retention."

**Practice this. Memorize the numbers.**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: Cells won't run**
**Solution:** Install missing libraries (see Prerequisites above)

### **Problem: Can't find data file**
**Solution:** Ensure `Telco_Customer_Churn.csv` is in same folder as notebook

### **Problem: Different results than expected**
**Solution:** This is normal (±2% due to randomness). Results will still be excellent.

### **Problem: Visualizations don't show**
**Solution:** Ensure Jupyter extension installed in VS Code
